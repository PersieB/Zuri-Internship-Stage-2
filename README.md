# Program
The program models a resume template. The profile section of the CV remains blank initially, waiting to be filled by user details upon submission of a form. The other sections of the CV have fixed content.

The program performs validations during the form filling. The form includes fields for:
First Name - required
Middle Name(s)
Last Name - required
Address / Location - required
Phone number - required
Email - required
Gender - required

The window stores the data provided by the user using the Javascript local storage feature  and redirects the page to view the CV template.
